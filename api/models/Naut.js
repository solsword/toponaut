 * Naut.js
 *
 * @description :: A 'naut is an explorer of topology. They have a thread
 *   (api/models/Thread.js) that tracks their current position, and as they
 *   encounter topos (api/models/Topo.js), they instantiate panels
 *   (api/models/Panel.js) which drive the user experience. Most 'nauts are
 *   user-controlled.
