 * @description :: A thread keeps track of a fractal location, storing it as a
 *   list all of panes that a 'naut has visited. These panes are kept alive by
 *   the thread, so that they can be revisited outwards. If a thread is cut,
 *   outward progress follows the canonical parent relationships defined by
 *   topos, which results in fresh panes being constructed in an outwards
 *   instead of inwards manner.
